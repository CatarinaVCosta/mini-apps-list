This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Before running the project it is necessary to run the following command, in the project directory:

### `npm run json:server`

This is to simulate a fake REST API. (Note: json-server requires at least version 10 of Node)
After running this command you can go to the browser to the following directory: http://localhost:8088/apps and you will see the response from the json file. 

All the available apps will be in that response.

Now you can run the project!

### `npm run start`

This will launch the app on the browser, and you will be ready to go.

### `npm run test`

To run all the available tests.
